## Landing Page Prototype

The landing page prototype was designed using Figma as a low-fidelity prototype.
Its purpose is to explore the basic layout, structure, and content hierarchy
of the home page of the web application.

The design follows fundamental visual design principles, with a focus on
consistency, readability, and clear visual hierarchy. CRAP principles are applied
through contrast to emphasize key sections, repetition of visual elements for
cohesion, alignment using a grid-based layout, and proximity to group related
content.

The prototype is not intended to be a final design, but rather an initial
iteration that allows for quick experimentation and future refinement.
